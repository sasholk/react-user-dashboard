## Description

This project is a web application built with React and TypeScript. It uses Bootstrap for responsive design and CSS modules for component-specific styles. The project also utilizes Vite for a faster and leaner development experience. Two Vite plugins are used: `@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh` for Fast Refresh using Babel and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for Fast Refresh using SWC.

The project is configured with ESLint for linting, and the configuration has been expanded to enable type aware lint rules. The ESLint configuration includes the `@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` and `@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked` rules. The `eslint-plugin-react` is also installed and the `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` rules are added to the `extends` list.
